    "Similar to a typical hemodialysis center, we consider 14 hours per day and 6 days per week (8:00 AM to 10:00 PM; Monday–Saturday). Patient available times for each day are generated independently. We split each day into two parts: morning and evening. Slots in each part of the day have an equal chance to be selected by patients (50% chance). More precisely, each day is composed of 14 ∗δslots. If a patient is available in the morning of a specific day (with 50% chance), then their ideal time slot is a random slot selected from { 1 , 2 , . . . , (14 ∗ κ) / 2 } . Likewise, if the patient is avail- able in the evening, his ideal time slot is randomly selected from { ((14 ∗ κ) / 2 ) + 1 , ((14 ∗ κ) / 2) + 2 , . . . , 14 ∗κ} . In case the selected evening slot doesn’t allow for a feasible dialysis appointment, a new slot is ran- domly selected. Note that it is possible that a patient is available in both parts of the day (with a 25% chance), i.e., the patient has two ideal time slots. In this case one appointment can be sched- uled in either of the slots (please note the one-day time separation between patient’s consecutive appointments). Dialysis treatment times are 4 hours, to comply with the average reported length of hemodialysis treatment. 6 We randomly generate three different priority weights for patients. Every patient jhas ζk chance of having priority k ∈ { 1 , 2 , 3 } , thus, receiving a w k j weight in the objec- tive function. We consider ζ1 = 0 . 6 , w 1 = 1 ; ζ2 = 0 . 25 , w 2 = 1 . 4 ; and ζ3 = 0 . 15 , w 3 = 2 ."

    "In the United States, a typical hemodialysis center, includ- ing our collaborating hemodialysis center, has approximately four hemodialysis patients per bed per day ( System, 2013 ). Consider- ing the expected growth in the demand for dialysis ( Medicare Pay- ment Advisory Commission, 2021 ), we evaluate the performance of our proposed BP algorithms for two patient-to-bed ratios of 4 and 5. For each patient-to-bed ratio, we consider time slot settings of 1 slot per hour and 2 slots per hour (half-hour slots). For each ratio-slot combination, we consider three maximum allowable de- viations from target times of 1 slot, 2 slots, and 4 slots. In terms of bed-patient size, the smallest instance starts with 10 beds and 40 patients, and the largest size represents a hemodialysis center with 20 beds and 100 patients. For every configuration in our test data set, we randomly generate 5 instances, resulting in a total of 270 instances, and report the average of 5 instances and the worst case for each configuration. 7"

    "\"In the current scheduling policy, patients are scheduled one at a time and based on the order that they are introduced to the center on a First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) basis. To respect the one- day separation constraint, patients are only scheduled on either odd or even days. Although schedules that use both odd and even days are also feasible, it was our observation that allowing for such schedules only worsens the schedules obtained using the FCFS policy. \n",
    "\n",
    "We implement this FCFS policy as follows. \n",
    "\n",
    "For each patient j, we select schedule a ∈ j with minimum ψ a that is feasible with respect to the above constraints and can also be feasibly assigned to a bed (i.e., has no overlap with slots occupied by patients { 1 , . . . , j −1 } ). \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that  j only contains schedules that are within δslot deviations from patient j’s ideal time slots. There- fore, the number of appointments in selected schedule a , may be less that the prescribed appointments for j. \n",
    "\n",
    "In that case, the leftover appointments, if any, are scheduled in one of the remaining feasible time slots. Figures 3 and 4 demonstrate the quality of schedules when em- ploying the FCFS policy as compared to the optimal schedules ob- tained by our proposed Enhanced CG-embedded BP algorithm, in terms of the percentage of leftover appointments (i.e.,  L ) and the hours of deviations per patient (i.e.,  D ). \n",
    "\n",
    "The optimal policy consistently produces schedules that outperform the FCFS policy in terms of the leftover appointments (average improvement of 98%) and the average deviation (average improvement of 46%). However, we observed that in some cases, the optimal policy returns sched- ules with higher appointment deviations (  D ), in order to find schedules that result in considerably lower leftover appointments. This is one of the major oversights that would be inevitable us- ing the FCFS policy. Tables A.5 and A.6 report the detailed results on the performance of the optimal policy developed using the En- hanced CG-embedded algorithm compared to the FCFS policy.\""
