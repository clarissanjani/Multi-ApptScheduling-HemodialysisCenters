Advanced Seminar Operations & Supply Chain Management: Operations Research
==============================
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a long-term (chronic) condition that affects the kidneys. The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs that are located below the ribcage. They filter waste products from the blood and help to regulate blood pressure, red blood cell production, and other important functions. When you have CKD, your kidneys gradually lose their ability to function properly. This can lead to a buildup of waste products in the blood, which can cause a variety of health such as fatigue, trouble sleeping, and shortness of breath.

## Project Details
**Description**: As part of seminar course at Technical University of Munich, I have created a final report that in this PDF, with the code accompanied. Further technical details of the project can be seen below. 

## Environment
The project was developed with Python 3.9. I used Pycharm as the IDE as well as used JupyterLab to run the notebooks. It is possible to run the notebooks also on Jupyter Notebook.

## Project Structure
Each task has its own separate folder structure with the relevant JupyterLab / Jupyter Notebook and python scripts. All the scripts are being called in the Jupyter notebook.

     ├── utils.py
     └── .gitignore

## How to access the file

To run the file, run the following in the folder directory if using Jupyter Notebook in the terminal. 

```
jupyter notebook
```

To run the file, run the following in the folder directory if using JupyterLab in the terminal.
