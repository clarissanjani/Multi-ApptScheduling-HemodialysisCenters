Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a long-term (chronic) condition that affects the kidneys. The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs that are located below the ribcage. They filter waste products from the blood and help to regulate blood pressure, red blood cell production, and other important functions. When you have CKD, your kidneys gradually lose their ability to function properly. This can lead to a buildup of waste products in the blood, which can cause a variety of health such as fatigue, trouble sleeping, and shortness of breath.
