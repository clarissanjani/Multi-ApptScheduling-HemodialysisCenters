Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a long-term (chronic) condition that affects the kidneys. The kidneys are two bean-shaped organs that are located below the ribcage. They filter waste products from the blood and help to regulate blood pressure, red blood cell production, and other important functions. When you have CKD, your kidneys gradually lose their ability to function properly. This can lead to a buildup of waste products in the blood, which can cause a variety of health such as fatigue, trouble sleeping, and shortness of breath

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has emerged as a significant global public health concern, characterizedby substantial morbidity, mortality, and escalating healthcare expenses [Couser et al., 2011]. Theprevalence of CKD has reached an estimated 850 million individuals living with the condition in 2017, meaning that this figure surpasses the estimated global prevalence of diabetes by twofold and exceedsthe prevalence of HIV or AIDS by more than 20 times.
